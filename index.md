# Welcome

This website is meant to be a resource for Econometrics students learning R. It is both an R package and a series of articles that explain how to use R for statistics and how to do it in a zen-like way. There are three purposes of this package:

## 1. Metapackage

A metapackage is a package that contains other packages. When you install this package, you will also install a curated list of packages that I have created. I feel this is the fastest way to get you "set up" with a complete environment for R stats.

## 2. Documentation

The series of articles on this website are created from TA review sessions where I covered important aspects of programming in R. There are two sections:

* **The Art of Metrics** contains articles on all of the basic estimation and inference techniques from an advanced undergraduate or first-semester graduate econometrics class. It focuses heavily on comparisons with Stata and aims to build a foundational set of metrics tools.
* **The Zen of Programming** has a completely different focus from the previous section. What budding computer scientists (a.k.a. you) sometimes miss is that there is a whole world of non-technical skills that make programming more productive, fun, and _reproducible_. This has been dubbed the "Hidden Curriculum" of data science by Prof. Scott Cunningham. The Zen of Programming aims to take the "hidden" out of that title and teach a set of skills for project management that help you produce high-quality, shareable, and understandable academic research.
